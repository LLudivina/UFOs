# UFOs

# Overview of Project
In this module, we were introduced to JavaScript and it's updates.  JavaScript was developed in 1995 and has gone through some major updates.  In 2015, JavaScript underwent its sixth update, including updates to the syntax.  This major update commonly refer to as ES6, ES6+, ES2015, OR ECMAScript 2015 and was very well received by the programming community because it made it easier to read and write code.

For this module's challenge, we were tasked with helping Dana, a data journalist, write about her town called McMinnville, Oregon and its UFO sighting information.  Since Dana decided to create a UFO website for UFO enthusiasts, dynamic content was created with JavaScript.  First, a table was created using the sighting information data stored in the JavaScipt array. Second, filters were set-up for user input. Finally, the table was placed in a HTML file for easy viewing. 

## *Purpose*
The purpose of this challenge was to provide information about UFO sightings by creating dynamic content with JavaScript.
