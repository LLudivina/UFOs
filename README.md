# UFOs

# Overview of Project

In this module, we were introduced to JavaScript and it's updates.  According to the module, JavaScript was developed in 1995 and has gone through some major updates.  In 2015, JavaScript underwent its sixth update, including updates to the syntax.  This major update commonly refer to as ES6, ES6+, ES2015, OR ECMAScript 2015 and was very well received by the programming community because it made it easier to read and write code. 

For this module, we were tasked with helping Dana.  Dana is a data journalist and wanted to write about her town called McMinnville in Oregon and its UFO sightings.  Since Dana decided to create a UFO website for UFO enthusiasts, dynamic content was created with JavaScript.  First, a table was created using the sighting information data stored in the JavaScipt array. Second, filters were set-up for user input. Finally, the table was placed in a HTML file for easy viewing. 

## *Purpose*
The purpose of this challenge was to create a dynamic table using JavaScript and incorporate it into a website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

# Results
JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap used to complete the challenge and generate the following results. 

## Figure 1

For our HTML, 4 list elements were created.  The elements called city, state, country, and shape were created to provide different search parameters.  The code can be seen in Figure 1. 

## Figure 2

Ideally, search results should look like the ones in Figure 2.  However, I had a hard time getting it to work. 

# Summary
This project was an amazing experience.  However, there were some drawbacks.  For example, it only provides information from the provided data. There is also no information about the number of witnesses.  There is no search button and I had a hard time using the website.  To address some of this drawbacks, I would recommend the following for further development.  A box should be added to include other possible UFO sightings. It would also be nice to have a comment section for discussions.
